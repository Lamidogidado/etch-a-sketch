# Etch-a-Sketch Project

## Introduction

This project aims to create a digital Etch-a-Sketch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Users will be able to move a virtual "pen" across a grid of squares, leaving a trail as they move. The project will include features to change the color of the trail and clear the grid.

## Skills to be Demonstrated

By the end of this project, I will have demonstrated proficiency in the following skills:

* **HTML Structure:** Creating the basic layout and elements of the web page, including the grid container and controls.
* **CSS Styling:** Styling the grid, the "pen" effect, and the overall appearance of the application. This will involve working with layout properties, colors, and potentially transitions.
* **JavaScript DOM Manipulation:** Dynamically creating and manipulating the grid elements, responding to user input (mouse movements or button clicks), and updating the styles of the grid cells.
* **Event Handling:** Implementing event listeners to capture user interactions for drawing, changing colors, and clearing the grid.
* **Basic JavaScript Logic:** Implementing the drawing logic and control functionalities.
* **Git and GitHub:** Version control the project and host it online. (You've already started this!)
* **Deployment with GitHub Pages:** Making the project accessible live on the web. (This will be a final step).

## Getting Started (Initial Steps)
